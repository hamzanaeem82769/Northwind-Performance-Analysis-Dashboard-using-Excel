his project focuses on data analysis using the Northwind Traders dataset in Microsoft Excel to evaluate and visualize business performance across multiple dimensions. The analysis involves comprehensive use of Power Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation, Data Modeling for establishing relationships between tables, and Power Pivot to create advanced measures for accurate insights.

Key analyses include total revenue by month and day, yearly and quarterly sales performance, customer order behavior such as total and average orders per month and year, and product-level profitability including revenue by category and top-performing products. Interactive Pivot Tables and visual dashboards were developed to summarize these findings effectively.

To enhance usability, slicer filters for day, month, and year were integrated, allowing users to dynamically filter and view data trends instantly. The dashboard incorporates essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total customers, total products, total orders, and average orders per customerâ€”each calculated using Power Pivot measures.

This macro-enabled Excel file (.xlsm) serves as a professional, data-driven reporting tool that enables business users to monitor performance trends, identify growth opportunities, and make informed decisions through clear visual insights.
